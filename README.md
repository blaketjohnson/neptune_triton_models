# Neptune-Triton Thesis: Dynamics in the Restricted Three-Body Problem

## Overview
This repository contains my graduate thesis work, which analyzes the orbital dynamics of the Neptune-Triton system using advanced methods in celestial mechanics. The project models both the Restricted Two-Body and Restricted Three-Body Problems (R2BP & RTBP), computes key quantities like the Jacobi constant, identifies the Lagrange points, visualizes zero-velocity curves, and assesses the stability of these equilibrium points.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this research is to understand the complex dynamics of the Neptune-Triton system by:
- Simulating Tritonâ€™s orbit around Neptune using the two-body problem.
- Extending the analysis to include the effects of a third body (RTBP), which introduces additional dynamical features.
- Computing the Jacobi constant to define energy boundaries in the rotating frame.
- Locating the Lagrange points where gravitational and centrifugal forces balance.
- Visualizing zero-velocity curves that outline forbidden regions for satellite motion.
- Analyzing the stability of the Lagrange points through eigenvalue analysis.
